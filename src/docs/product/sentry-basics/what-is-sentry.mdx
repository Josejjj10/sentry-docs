Sentry is a software monitoring tool that helps developers identify and fix code-related issues. From error tracking to performance monitoring, Sentry provides code-level observability that makes it easy to diagnose issues and learn continuously about your application code health.

## What can Sentry Help With?

As a full-stack application monitoring solution, Sentry provides features such as:

### Error Monitoring

Sentry’s error monitoring capabilities make it possible to quickly get to the root of a problem so you can understand and fix what’s broken.

All unhandled exceptions are automatically captured, with individual errors rolling up into larger issues. Similar errors are grouped together into one issue so you can triage and manage issues more efficiently with reduced noise.

- For web projects, you can set up **session replays** and **source maps** so you can see exactly what the user experienced on your app and connect that error to the problem line of code.
- If you set up Sentry for your frontend and backend, we provide **distributed tracing** to make it easy to connect the dots and quickly get to the root of the issue.
- Additionally, you can use **integrations** to link your source code so that Sentry can surface **suspect commits** and **stack traces** to show the problem line of code, as well as **suggest assignees** for issues based on commit authors.

The visibility you get with Sentry enables you to diagnose issues in your application and understand the impact a given error is having on your user base.

### Performance Monitoring

Our performance monitoring feature helps you track application performance, measure metrics like throughput and latency, and see the impact of errors across multiple services.

- It captures **distributed traces** consisting of transactions and spans to measure the performance of individual services and operations, helping you drill down into any slowdowns and optimize the performance of your code. This means you can easily t[race](https://blog.sentry.io/find-the-root-cause-faster-with-trace-view-and-quick-trace/) slow-loading pages all the way back to poor-performing API calls.
- Sentry **profiles** code in every environment your application is running on so you can quickly see which functions are contributing to a slow span. **Profiling** provides code-level insights into your application performance in production so you can find and fix the problem line of code faster.
- Sentry also surfaces transactions that have had significant changes in their performance over time, making it easy to discover any **trends** and act on them before they become a bigger problem.


### Release Health Monitoring

Get real-time visibility across releases to see core metrics like crash-free sessions, version adoption, and failure rate so you can see the moment a release starts to degrade and quickly take action.

Releases are also integrated with the rest of Sentry. You can see directly from an error or performance issue how it was affected by a release and also resolve the issue for a specific release.

### Recurring Job Monitoring

Cron Monitors allows you to monitor the uptime and performance of any scheduled, recurring job in Sentry. Once implemented, it'll allow you to get alerts and metrics to help you solve errors, detect timeouts, and prevent disruptions to your service.

### Visibility Into Your Data Across Environmentss

  [**Discover**](https://try.sentry-demo.com/demo/start/?scenario=discover&projectSlug=react&source=docs) provides visibility into your data across environments by building upon and enriching your error data. You can [**query**](https://try.sentry-demo.com/demo/start/?scenario=oneDiscoverQuery&projectSlug=react&source=docs) and unlock insights into the health of your entire system and get answers to critical business questions — all in one place. Use Discover to view comprehensive information sent to Sentry.

### Code Coverage

  Codecov provides **test code coverage** for developers. It helps improve testing, coverage, and code reliability. With Codecov, you can get test coverage insights in Sentry directly as you monitor your errors.

### Seamless Developer Workflow

  Sentry provides many integrations to support seamless developer workflow, including:

  - Source code management, code mapping, code owners, and suspect commits with GitHub
  - Issue tracking with Jira & Github
  - Alerts and notifications with Slack & Discord

### SDK Support for Over 100 Platforms

  Sentry supports over 100 platforms and frameworks, including 30+ coding languages, so you can track errors and performance issues no matter what your application is built on. Our SDKs make it easy to get started with Sentry – it only takes a few lines of code!

## Get Started with Sentry

Getting started is simple. After you’ve created a sentry organization, create a new project, choosing from dozens of frameworks. Set your alert preferences, and assign the project you’d like to monitor to a team. Then, just copy the initialization method into your app. Then Sentry will start sending errors and performance events. Most apps send a large number of events so to make them more actionable we group similar events into issues based on first-in-class fingerprinting.

After you have Sentry set up, make sure to do these 3 things to help you get the most value out of Sentry:

1. Make sure you're sending us your code (source maps)
2. Set up alerts to get notified when something goes wrong (integrations with jira, github)
3. Understand how to read and fix what discover & dashboards tell you
